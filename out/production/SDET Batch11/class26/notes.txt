Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object classes arount primitive data type
    that have built in methods and are used as objects where necessary.
    for example in collection framework.
Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects
Boxing:
   The conversion of primitive data types into its
   equivalent Wrapper is called boxing
for example:
   Integer i =new Integer(10); // boxing
AutoBoxing:
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its
    equivalent Wrapper is called AutoBoxing
    Integer i = 10;
Unboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types
    is called unboxing
    Integer i =new Integer(10); // boxing
    int i2 = i.valueOf(); // unboxing
AutoUnboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing
    Integer i = 10; // autoBoxing
    int i2=i; // autoUnboxing
Collection Framework:
    Collection providers architecture to store and manipulate the
group of object that represented as a single unit
we have many interfaces and clasees inside the framework to achieve this.
    Arraylist
    <> diamond operator is used to specify the data type in collections framework
    ArrayList<Double> numbers = new ArrayList();
    add().... add the element to the arraylist
